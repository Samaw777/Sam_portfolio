# [Predicting NFL Match usingArtificial Neural Network](https://github.com/Samaw777/NFL_Game_predictor)
 The model uses open-source statistic data of  each  team  such  as,  passing  yard,  rushing  yards,  fumble  lost,  and  scoring. Each statistical data has offensive and defensive. For instance, a  data  set  of  anticipated  values  for  a  specific  matchup  is  created  by  comparing  the  offensive  passing  yards  obtained  by  one  team  to  the  defensive  passing  yards  given  by  the  opposition.  We  evaluated  the  modelâ€™s performance by contrasting its result with those of established prediction algorithms. This Project is using neural network to predict the score of NFL match and then predict the winner of the game.
 # user interface using Django 
 The user interface was created to improve the user's experience when utilizing the created prediction model. In this business, a positive user or customer experience with the offered product is essential. The model will be challenging to use when it is in the backend stage, therefore we gave it a straightforward user interface related to the model using Django
